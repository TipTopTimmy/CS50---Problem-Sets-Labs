Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Switzerland seems to be overvalued when N is small. The larger N gets Switzerland's
probability of winning the tournament decreases.
Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: The results seem to stabilize at around the N=1000 and the time cost to simulate 10000 times is approximately
3x that of 1000 simulations. I would simulate 1000 times and call it good enough.
